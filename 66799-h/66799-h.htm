<p class='ul ni'>DITCHING PROCEDURE</p>

<p>1. The first series of ditching positions for the B-29 were suggested
by the "BOEING AIRCRAFT COMPANY", manufacturers of the aircraft. These
positions were on trial, but were as logical as could be devised without
actual ditching experience. The Boeing procedure and its various
modifications have all been steps in the right direction. Changes have
been based on actual ditching experience and procedures set forth here
are results of all ditching experiences to date. They are not to be
considered permanent. As new ditching characteristics of the B-29 are
learned, they will be incorporated to assure the safest procedures
possible.</p>

<p>2. The importance of these approved methods cannot be stressed too
highly. Modifications in these procedures may
<span class='ul'>NOT</span> be made at the discretion of the airplane
commander.</p>

<p>3. Experience to date proves that ditching characteristics of the
B-29 are superior to those of any other aircraft now used by the Army
Air Forces. The greatest factor in ditching is the airplane's buoyancy
qualities. The B-29 has demonstrated, even during mediocre ditchings,
that it will stay afloat for long periods and does not sink easily. On a
moderately successful ditching, the aircraft is apt to stay afloat for
at least ten (10) minutes and may float for several hours.</p>

<p>4. Ditching impacts are severe. Every precaution must be taken to pad
against impact in the ditching position. Parachute, cushions, clothing,
etc., will be used for this purpose. During impact the individual's head
must be well protected. The flak helmet will be worn only when the head
can be braced against something substantial. In all positions, the legs
should be flexed to absorb the effects of a sudden jar.</p>

<p>5. When injured crew members are aboard they will be put in the
proper positions and/or supported between the legs of other crew
position. This may be difficult, but it has proven successful on
numerous occasions.</p>

<p>6. Ditching position practice, as a part of completed ditching drill,
is a "MUST" for all combat crews. Every step in ditching procedure must
be practiced and learned thoroughly by the entire crew as a unit, in
order to eliminate confusion. Practice it against time until the entire
process becomes second nature.</p>

<p class='ni'>Paragraphs 7 through 91 are Ditching Procedure
instructions for the various B-29 crew positions. These are reproduced
separately for insertion in the applicable S.O.P.'s for these
positions.</p>

<p>92. If time permits, take one or more parachutes from the ditched
aircraft. The silk can be used to catch rain water and the shrouds have
no end of use. The web belt, which supports the canteen, should be
buckled on after removal of flak vests.</p>

<p>93. Prior to ditching all escape hatches will be jettisoned or opened
to prevent jamming in the event that the fuselage accordions.</p>

<p>94. An important phase of crew cooperation is the estimation of time
remaining aloft and the position where the ditching will take place. The
most efficient Air-Sea Rescue Agency is only as efficient as the
cooperation it receives from crews in distress. The rescue agency must
get notification of the ditching and the position. Crews must practice
transmitting procedure until it becomes S.O.P. The engineer, with the
information available, will make an estimate as to the time remaining
aloft. This information will to passed to the navigator, who, on the
basis of the information supplied, will estimate the position of
ditching. The position will be given to the radio operator who will
transmit the information to personnel who can effect a rescue.</p>

<p>95. This system of cooperation will not always be applicable, but it
is a framework for crew cooperation.</p>

<p class='ul ni'>EQUIPMENT:</p>

<p>96. Combat crews are subject to last-minute changes in aircraft.
Therefore, it is essential to standardize the location of emergency
equipment within the aircraft. Individual responsibility for the removal
of this equipment must also be fixed.</p>

<p>97. The locations of the emergency equipment are based on their
accessibility for the crews when in ditching position.</p>

<p>98. The later B-29 aircraft are equipped with the new modified E-2
raft. This raft has its accessory kit lashed to the raft itself. The
older type utilizes the A-3 raft which stows the accessory kit in the
airplane proper.</p>

<p class='ul ni'>CHANGES:</p>

<p>99. As new developments are made in the Air-Sea Rescue field,
existing procedures and equipment will be modified. Research in this
field is being conducted in the United States as well as in the theatres
of operation. The new information, as it becomes available, will to
disseminated to the units of the command via publications and by
Personal Equipment Officers.</p>

<p class='tac ni'>----------END----------</p>

<p>100. A combat crew thoroughly trained in procedures and equipment is
a crew with plenty of life assurance which may, one day, pay the largest
kind of dividend----HUMAN LIFE------.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
